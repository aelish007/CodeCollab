# GitHub Push Instructions

Your CodeBoard project has been prepared for GitHub. Follow these steps to push your code to your GitHub repository:

## 1. Create a GitHub Repository

If you haven't already, create a new repository on GitHub:

1. Go to https://github.com/new
2. Name your repository (e.g., "CodeBoard")
3. Choose public or private visibility
4. Do NOT initialize with README, .gitignore, or license (as we already have these files)
5. Click "Create repository"

## 2. Update Remote URL

The repository is currently configured with a placeholder URL. Update it with your actual GitHub repository URL by running this command in your terminal:

```
git remote set-url origin https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/YOUR-REPOSITORY-NAME.git
```

Replace `YOUR-USERNAME` and `YOUR-REPOSITORY-NAME` with your actual GitHub username and repository name.

## 3. Push Your Code

Push your code to GitHub with this command:

```
git push -u origin master
```

You may be prompted to enter your GitHub credentials.

## 4. Verify

Visit your GitHub repository in a web browser to verify that your code has been pushed successfully.

## Note

- The `.env` file has been excluded from the repository as requested.
- Other common files like `node_modules`, logs, and build outputs are also excluded.
- If you need to make changes to what files are excluded, edit the `.gitignore` file.
